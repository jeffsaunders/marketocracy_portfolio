                                <p>When you subscribe to Marketocracy’s paid services you are committing to a one year agreement, paid either in full in advance or in Monthly Payments for the full term of the commitment.  Your subscription will automatically renew on your anniversary date <?php /*?>(available on your {account settings page} [Link to logged in member’s settings page, leave as text if not logged in])<?php */?> and you will be charged at the start of each subscription year using the method defined in your customer account settings. You must change those settings at least one day before your next subscription renewal date if you wish to change the payment terms or payment method.  You must cancel your paid subscription at least one day before the end of your current annual agreement term to avoid being charged for the following year.  Once successfully cancelled your account will revert to the “Free” Basic level.</p>
                                <p>Once your subscription fee has been charged at the start of an annual agreement, you have 7 days from the start of your annual term to cancel your subscription for a refund.  No other refunds are offered.  ALL SALES ARE FINAL.</p>
                                <p><strong>Free Trial</strong></p>
                                <p>All new subscribers receive a complimentary Pro Level membership for the first 30 days, after which your account will revert to a Free Basic Level membership.  If you subscribe to either a Basic Level or Plus Level membership during your trial period, your membership will transition to the level to which you subscribed at the end of the initial 30 days.  In the case you subscribed to a Pro Level membership your access will simply continue as-is.</p>
                                
                                <p><strong>Free Level Membership</strong></p>
                                <p>Free Basic memberships are limited to one per person.  Abuse will result in termination of all accounts for that member.  <?php /*?>See {link} for details on the services and features offered with each membership level.<?php */?></p>
                                
                                <?php /*?><p>Payment for your subscription is due in advance of the subscription period you select. Your subscription will continue and will renew automatically unless terminated by us in accordance with this Agreement or until you notify us of your decision to terminate your subscription. The appropriate annual, monthly, or similar periodic fee for your subscription will be billed automatically at the beginning of each renewal period, to the credit card you designated during the registration process (or subsequently changed) unless you cancel your subscription before the renewal period begins.</p>
                                
                                <p>If you wish to cancel your quarterly or yearly subscription in the middle of a subscription period, the refund will be prorated based on the number of months left in the subscription period, with the month of cancellation charged fully. Monthly subscriptions cannot be cancelled mid-cycle, the cancellation will take effect in the following calendar month.</p>
                                
                                <p>You agree to pay all fees and charges incurred in connection with your username and password (including any applicable taxes) at the rates in effect when the charges were incurred.</p>
                                
                                <p>You agree to pay all amounts due upon our demand. In the event we have to collect unpaid amounts you owe us, you will be liable for all attorneys' and collection agency fees.</p>

WE WILL NOTIFY YOU OF ANY SUCH CHANGES IN ADVANCE AND IF ANY CHANGES ARE NOT ACCEPTABLE, YOU MAY TERMINATE YOUR SUBSCRIPTION ACORDING TO THE CANCELLATION POLICY OUTLINED ABOVE.</p><?php */?>
