                                <p>Marketocracy collects information from different parts of our web site. Some personal information is gathered when you register. During registration, Marketocracy asks for your name, email address, and mailing address. The more information you volunteer, the better we are able to customize your experience. Once registered, you are no longer anonymous to Marketocracy - you are given a login ID and password which provide access to all of Marketocracy's many offerings. In addition to registration, we may ask you for personal information at other times, including (but not limited to) when you enter a contest or promotion sponsored by Marketocracy and/or our business partners; when you post information in the Marketocracy forums; and when you report a problem with our site or services. If you contact Marketocracy we may keep a record of your correspondence. Marketocracy may also occasionally ask users to complete surveys that we use for research purposes. Wherever we collect personal information, we will make an effort to include a link to this privacy policy on that page.</p>

                                <p>Marketocracy's primary goal in collecting personal information is to specifically identify each of its users and provide the best service possible for each. In addition to the use of personal information to operate the site, Marketocracy also gathers anonymous information, which may be used by Marketocracy or shared with its partners. This information does not personally identify you, but may be helpful for marketing purposes or for improving the services we offer. Generally, this information is collected through "traffic data" and may entail the use of "cookies" "IP addresses" or other numeric codes used to identify a computer.</p>
                                <p>When we show rankings of Marketocracy members and their funds, we will use your unique member login name as a screen name. These rankings will also include fund names as they are titled on the site. Please ensure that all information included in login names and fund titles is acceptable to you for public display. Members can change their fund names on the "Fund Settings" page.</p>

You must change those settings at least one day before your next subscription renewal date if you wish to change the payment terms or payment method.  You must cancel your paid subscription at least one day before the end of your current annual agreement term to avoid being charged for the following year.
