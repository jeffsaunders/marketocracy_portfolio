                	<p style="font-size:14px;">The following are additional rules required only for individuals who wish their funds to be given an official Marketocracy Performance Ranking. Performance Ranking is an educational and skill metric, it is not a chance contest or game; there are no prizes. Ranking is required for individuals wanting consideration as fund managers, but ranking is not an offer of employment. Individuals who are using Marketocracy's tools solely for their own education and personal use will not be subject to the following rules. We supply a compliance report to help you track your compliance for each of your virtual funds.</p>

                                	<li>To qualify for ranking, funds must have a start date prior to the beginning of the ranking period. For example, for a fund to be ranked for Q1, it must be started on or before Dec 31st. Funds started during a ranking time period will be automatically considered for the following time period.</li>
                                    <li>
                                    	Just like real mutual fund portfolios, all model funds at Marketocracy must pass a diversification test. In our case, funds are considered "non-diversified" mutual funds. Here's how the Marketocracy diversification test works: For a majority of each period, your fund must meet guidelines that are similar to SEC and IRS rules regarding fund position concentrations. For your fund to be "non-diversified":
                                    	<br /><br />
                                        <ul>
                                        	<li>No position can exceed 25% of your total portfolio value.</li>
                                            <li>Half your portfolio must be comprised of positions under 10% each.</li>
                                            <li>Your cash position isn't limited by this guideline, although you must be 65% invested, see below (but if you've got too much cash, your performance may suffer!).</li>
                                            <li>Take a look at this example: Let's say that your $1,000,000 fund holds 23% of total assets in Apple, a 22% stake in Lucent, and 8% stakes in Cisco, Yahoo, Amazon, and Charles Schwab - with the balance in cash. This fund complies with the diversification test because the Apple and Lucent positions, totaling 45%, or $450,000, make up less than half of the fund's value, with neither position exceeding 25% (or $250,000). In the other half of the fund, no one position (excluding cash) totals more than 10% of fund assets.</li>
                                    	</ul>
                                    	
                                        <br />
                                        
                                        <strong>Funds that do not pass the quarterly diversification test will be disqualified from the Marketocracy Performance Rankings.</strong><br /><br />
                                        
                                        Funds will also be monitored for style drift. For a majority of each quarter, both general and industry specific funds must have at least 65% invested in stocks corresponding to their investment focus. Cash is not considered a qualified investment when calculating the 65% investment threshold. All funds, regardless of focus, must be 65% invested in securities a majority of the time.<br /><br />

										<strong>Funds that fail to meet these criteria will be disqualified from the Marketocracy Performance Rankings.</strong><br /><br />
                                        Your fund must be in compliance with the diversification testing and style drift for a majority of the period in order to be considered for ranking.

                                    </li>
                                    
                                    <li>No member may buy into a position that is greater than 25% of the fund value. If you violate this rule, your fund will be out of compliance until you sell enough of the errant stock to bring its value below 25% of your fund's total value AND you have brought your fund back into complete compliance with ALL other Marketocracy rules. In addition, the effective inception date of your fund will be reset to the date that you bring the fund back into compliance with ALL Marketocracy rules.<br /><br />
                                    
                                    For example, if a fund violates the "25% rule" on September 14, 2003, then comes back into compliance on October 20, 2003, the effective start date for the fund will be October 20, 2003. The fund will not be eligible for year 2003 fourth quarter ranking, as its effective start date is after the beginning of the fourth quarter. In addition, the fund will not be eligible for m100 rankings until 6 months after October 20, 2003, and will not be eligible for ITD rankings until one year afterwards.<br /><br />
                                    
                                    Note that while a position in the fund may appreciate above the 25% cap, even an appreciation to over 25% will have to be adjusted in order to meet the compliance rule for a majority of the period.</li>

                                	<li>No fund can hold more than 25% of invested assets in Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) for a majority of the quarter. ETFs include exchange traded indices such as QQQ.</li>
                                	
                                    <li>To further simulate the experience of running an actual mutual fund, the top funds ranked by quarterly performance in each fund category may receive fantasy cash "inflows" or new investments on a periodic basis in the following quarter. Similarly, a certain number of the worst performing funds in each fund category may have fantasy cash "outflows", or redemptions of cash, in the following quarter. Fantasy cash inflow and outflow amounts will be calculated based on performance ranking and are credited to, or debited from, funds at times and in amounts that are at the sole discretion of Marketocracy, Inc. 
Cash inflows and outflows do not change your fund's NAV; however, having extra cash on hand from new investments in the fund, or having to sell positions to raise cash for fund redemptions, may affect fund performance.</li>

									<li>In order to qualify for ranking, individuals must have, and must certify that they have, only one account on the Marketocracy website. Individuals with multiple accounts will be disqualified.</li>
                            		<li>In order to qualify for ranking, funds cannot be set up that simply mirror other existing funds (either virtual funds on Marketocracy or existing funds in the market.) Marketocracy reserves the right to disqualify such "mirror" funds. A fund is considered a “mirror” fund if the holdings overlap with another fund (real or virtual) in excess of 50% of total fund value.</li>
                                    
                                    <li>To qualify for rankings in a particular sector, your fund must have 65% of its invested assets (excluding cash) in a given sector. Marketocracy currently uses the S&amp;P Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) to sort stocks into sectors. (For further details regarding GICS, see the S&amp;P website). Companies are classified into each sector by S&amp;P, and that is the classification utilized on the site. Check your Sector report for each Marketocracy fund to get a breakdown of your portfolio by sector.<br /><br />

Funds that qualify for a given sector will automatically be considered for sector rankings, as long as they meet all compliance rules. All compliant funds, regardless of sector, are eligible for the overall rankings. It is not necessary to be in a particular sector to qualify for the overall rankings, this rule only applies to those who wish their funds to be eligible for sector rankings. To get a breakdown of a fund by sector, click on the fund's name, then click on the "sectors" link under the "my funds" heading in the left navbar.</li>

									<li>No trading of options, bonds, futures, commodities or mutual funds is permitted in order to qualify for ranking.</li>
                                    
                                    <li> Funds will be allowed to have a negative cash balance of up to 5% of total assets under management in order to provide a buffer for filling orders and charging management fees. In the event that a member’s fund develops an excessive negative balance, it may not total more than 7 days per quarter and it must be cleared by the end of each calendar quarter in order to qualify for ranking. Negative balances are to cover short-term differences in cash needs versus available cash, not to fund purchases (i.e. margin purchases).</li>

Marketocracy's goal is to utilize the virtual track records on our website to find the best investors in the world.

                                    <li>Rankings are determined during each time period based on the information we have at hand at the end of each time period. In order to be eligible for ranking, a fund must a) be created before the start of the ranking period and b) comply with all Marketocracy rules for at least 50% of the ranking period.<br /><br />

In addition, to be eligible for inception-to-date (ITD) rankings, the fund must be at least one year old. For m100 rankings, the fund must be at least 6 months old. The minimum required fund lifespan will increase as the number and lifespan of compliant Marketocracy funds continues to rise.<br /><br />

Note that if you violate the rule against buying into a position that is greater than 25% of the fund's value, the effective inception date of your fund will be reset to the date that you bring the fund back into compliance with ALL Marketocracy rules.<br /><br />

If a member feels an error has been made in their account regarding their virtual funds' performance or compliance calculations, the member must contact Marketocracy via support@marketocracy.com prior to the end of the period in question. Marketocracy reserves the right to make the final judgment on all performance ranking.</li>
