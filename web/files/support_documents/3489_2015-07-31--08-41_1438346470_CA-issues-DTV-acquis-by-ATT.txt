look for shorts in member's active, long funds
select fundkey from mposition where stockkey=X'98ef736e4028c8dfc0a80146'  and totalshares < 0;
if there are some, then do this
select active, kindkey, primarykey, symbol from mfund where active=1 and kindkey= X'70443ca1391e026fc0a8015c' and primarykey in (select fundkey from mposition where stockkey=X'98ef736e4028c8dfc0a80146'  and totalshares < 0);
> Row 1:

>   PRIMARYKEY = X'14886d104fa2305bc0a80146'
>       SYMBOL = L24


now get the login names based on stockkey - fill in the stockkey
select loginname from mmanager where primarykey in (select managerkey from mportfolio where primarykey in (select portfoliokey from mfund where active=1 and kindkey= X'70443ca1391e026fc0a8015c' and primarykey in (select fundkey from mposition where stockkey=X'98ef736e4028c8dfc0a80146'  and totalshares < 0)));
> Row 1:
