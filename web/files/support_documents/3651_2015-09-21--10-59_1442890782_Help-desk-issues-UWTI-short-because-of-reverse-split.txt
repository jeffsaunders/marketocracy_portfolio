[9/11/15, 10:00:05 AM] Brandon McCarthy: Member: csikes1 is short in his ULTRA fund.
[9/11/15, 10:00:48 AM] Brandon McCarthy: His trade quants add up to exactly how many shares he had. So he should be at zero, but there is also a split on the 10th. Maybe that had something to do with it.

the CA sold out his 27000 shares of UWTI and bought 2700  that is the 1/10th
he had three sells 
9312

let's do three trades

9312 / 10 = 931.2  round down to 931
9000 / 10 = 900
8688 / 10 = 868.8  round up to 869

Ok, I backed out his three trades and he has this now:

We scaled back your UWTI shares rather than selling 27000 shares (pre-split) you only had 2700 shares.
that reduced your cash 

we need to trim back your Apple shares you bought on this day.

900+900+889 = 2689 shares 

total buy cash for Apple 302,893.90

on 9/10/15  had a starting cash amount of -$15,899.90	

gained this from the sell of UWTI

Sell	UWTI	869	$11.46	$9,958.56	$43.45	$0.18

30739.73  gain from sell of UWTI (2700 shares)

30739.73 -  15,899.90 = 14839.83  available cash

14839.83 / 112.58  =  about 130 shares of AAPL

conferred with Brandon, we'll wait to see what the member says.
