Company's Online Profile
FUND DESCRIPTION:  PowerShares Global Coal Portfolio is an exchange-traded index fund or Index ETF which is a separate investment portfolio of the PowerShares Exchange-Traded Fund Trust II, an open-ended investment management company. INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE: PowerShares Global Coal Portfolio seeks investment results that correspond, before fees and expenses, generally to the price and yield performance of the NASDAQ OMX Global Coal Index. INDEX DESCRIPTION: The NASDAQ OMX Global Coal Index is designed to measure the overall performance of globally traded securities of the largest and most liquid companies involved in the coal industry and is calculated and maintained by NASDAQ OMX (the Index Provider). As of December 31, 2009, the Index included consisted of approximately 29 securities of companies with market capitalizations between $421.3 million and $86.4 billion. FUND STRATEGY: The Fund will normally invest at least 90% of its total assets in the securities that comprise the Index and ADRs and GDRs based on the securities in the Index. The Fund anticipates that the majority of its investments will be in the securities that comprise the Index rather than in ADRs and GDRs. The Fund will normally invest at least 80% of its total assets in securities of companies involved in the coal industry. The Fund will invest 25% or more of the value of its total assets in securities of issuers in an industry or group of industries to the extent that the Index concentrates in an industry or group of industries. FUND MANAGEMENT: Invesco PowerShares Capital Management LLC has overall responsibility as the Fund's investment adviser for the selection and ongoing monitoring of the Fund's investments, managing the Fund's business affairs and providing certain clerical, bookkeeping and other administrative services.
Notes:  1/25/2013 The issuer has determined to liquidate the fund on March 7, 2013. The fund will be closed to new investors at the close of regular trading on February 26, 2013; accordingly, trading in the funds will be suspended before the opening of business on February 27, 2013. 12/19/2012 Invesco PowerShares Capital Management LLC, a leading global provider of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) with more than $74 billion in franchise assets, announced changes to its product line. As part of its ongoing commitment to putting investors’ interests first, Invesco PowerShares announced that it plans to close 13 ETFs. The affected funds represent less than 1% of Invesco PowerShares’ total assets. At a Dec. 18, 2012 meeting, the PowerShares Funds Board of Trustees approved the closings. The final day of trading on The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC and NYSE Arca, Inc. will be Feb. 26, 2013. Shareholders may sell their holdings on or before Feb. 26, 2013, and may incur typical transaction fees from their broker-dealer. Shareholders who do not sell their holdings on or before Feb. 26, 2013, will receive cash equal to the amount of the net asset value of their shares, which will include any capital gains and dividends, in the cash portion of their brokerage accounts on the liquidation date (currently scheduled for March 7, 2013). Shareholders will generally recognize a capital gain or loss equal to the amount received for their shares over their adjusted basis in such shares.

look for shorts in member's active, long funds
select fundkey from mposition where stockkey=X'750b351149f677cdc0a80146'  and totalshares < 0;
if there are some, then do this
select active, kindkey, primarykey, symbol from mfund where active=1 and kindkey= X'70443ca1391e026fc0a8015c' and primarykey in (select fundkey from mposition where stockkey=X'750b351149f677cdc0a80146'  and totalshares < 0);
no shorts

now get the login names based on stockkey - fill in the stockkey
select loginname from mmanager where primarykey in (select managerkey from mportfolio where primarykey in (select portfoliokey from mfund where active=1 and kindkey= X'70443ca1391e026fc0a8015c' and primarykey in (select fundkey from mposition where stockkey=X'750b351149f677cdc0a80146'  and totalshares < 0)));
