Good Morning Marty, 

The buy of HD partners acquisition corp com (40415k100) data is not available on our pricing service. 
Can you confirm that the buy is correct on the trade ticket? 
If this is correct I will need to reaffirm the price of $21.03, and will need a price tonight for this security. 

Respectfully, 

Dan Jankowski
Fund Accountant

You have no sells for this position

Plan of attack.

1.  do the delist / acquis for old HDP

2.  check that these two members have the shares taken

3.  should be no members holding HDP after the delist

4.  list the new HDP  and get the new stockkey

5.  identify the mtickets which need to be moved from the old to the new stockkey

6.  get the ticketkeys - we'll need to tickle these

7.  get the fundkeys - we'll need to invalidate 

6.  identify the mpositions that point to the old stockkey
		where fundkey is   and the mposition has the old stockkey
	delete these mpositions

7.  identity the mtrades and delete these

8.  change the stockkey in the mtickets

9.  tickle the tickets

10..invalidate the funds

11.  check the results 


Ok, let's execute the plan:

Plan of attack.

1.  do the delist / acquis for old HDP

let's get the fundkeys for the acquis:
select fundkey from mposition where primarykey in (select positionkey from mtrade where ticketkey in (select primarykey from mticket where sourcekey=X'55bc07265537dc1dc0a86f92'));
> Row 1:

> Row 3:
>   FUNDKEY = X'788770e14d3c4f6ec0a80135'

once the acquis is applied, invalidate these funds
