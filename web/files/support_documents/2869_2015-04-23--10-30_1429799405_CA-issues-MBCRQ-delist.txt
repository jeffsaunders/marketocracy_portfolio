Security Type:   Bank Holding Company

Company's Online Profile
BUSINESS:  Mercantile Bancorp, Inc., headquartered in Quincy, Illinois, is a regionally owned and operated bank
 holding company formed in 1983 to bring together the resources of proven community banks in order to provide its markets the very best financial products, services, and technologies combined with superior community bank service. The company’s affiliate banks collectively offer a full line of FDIC-insured deposit services including checking accounts, savings accounts, money market accounts, certificates of deposit, and individual retirement accounts, as well as a complete line of lending services: consumer loans, credit cards, mortgage loans, home equity lines of credit, and commercial and agricultural loans and lines of credit. Additional services include asset management services: trusts, estate planning, investment services and farm management.

Notes:  November 28, 2011. Mercantile Bancorp, Inc. (NYSE Amex-MBR) filed on November 28, 2011 a Form 25, 
Notification of Removal from Listing and/or Registration under Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 
with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company anticipates that the Form 25 will become effective 10 days 
following its filing, and that the Common Stock would be removed from listing on NYSE Amex on or about 
December 8, 2011. Following anticipated delisting from NYSE Amex, the Common Stock will not be quoted on any stock 
exchange, and there cannot be any assurance that the shares will be quoted on any over-the-counter market.
On or after the effective date of delisting, the Company intends to file a Form 15 with the SEC to voluntarily
 effect the deregistration of its common stock. The Company is eligible to deregister by filing Form 15 because it 
has fewer than 300 holders of record of its common stock. Upon the filing of the Form 15, the Company’s obligations 
to file certain reports with the SEC, including Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K and proxy statements, will immediately be 
suspended.
