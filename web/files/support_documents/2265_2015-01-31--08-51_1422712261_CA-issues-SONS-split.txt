the split is not there yet -

let's check trades for this stockkey
STOCKKEY = X'596e0b4a396b8c58c0a801dc'
select count(*) from mticket where STOCKKEY = X'596e0b4a396b8c58c0a801dc' and closed >= TIMESTAMP'2015-01-30 00:00:00.000000';
there was 0
> Row 1:
>   _C001 = 1640.000000

select count(*) from mticket where STOCKKEY = X'596e0b4a396b8c58c0a801dc' and sourcekey is not null and closed >= TIMESTAMP'2015-01-30 00:00:00.000000';
> Row 1:
>   _C001 = 1640.000000

they are all CAs

and then after the CAs ran today

select * from mticket where STOCKKEY = X'596e0b4a396b8c58c0a801dc' order by closed;
select * from mstockalias where STOCKKEY = X'596e0b4a396b8c58c0a801dc';
