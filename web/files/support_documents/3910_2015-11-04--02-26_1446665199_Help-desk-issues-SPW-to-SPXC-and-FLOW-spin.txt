SPX corporation had a spinoff, called SPX FLOW. The new ticker symbol is FLOW. The original ticker was SPW. Now it is trading under SPXC. It appears that when the spinoff happened, I lost my shares of SPW, and got shares of FLOW, but I have no shares of SPXC. If I understand the situation correctly, I should have an equal number of shares of both FLOW and SPXC effective September 26, 2015. Here is where I got my information from: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/spx-corporation-declares-spin-off-dividend-of-spx-flow-inc-shares-300139377.html
