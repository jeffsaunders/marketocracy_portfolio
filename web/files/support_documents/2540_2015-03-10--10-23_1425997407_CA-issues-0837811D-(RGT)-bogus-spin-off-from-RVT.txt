Dec 31, 2014	0837811D US spun off from RVT with terms:1 per 7



found it by searchng on RVT trust

https://www.roycefunds.com/news/2013/09/rvt-announces-terms-spin-off-royce-global-value-trust

The spin-off of Royce Global Value Trust, Inc. (“Global Trust”), a newly organized, diversified, closed-end management investment company, was approved by the stockholders of Royce Value Trust, Inc. (NYSE:RVT) (“Value Trust”) on September 5, 2013.
Value Trust announced today that the distribution of Global Trust common stock to Value Trust stockholders is expected to be at a ratio of one (1) share of Global Trust common stock for every seven (7) shares of Value Trust common stock owned. Only whole shares of Global Trust common stock will be issued in connection with the spin-off; Value Trust stockholders will receive cash in lieu of fractional shares of Global Trust common stock. The fractional shares of Global Trust common stock that otherwise would have been issued in the spin-off will be aggregated and sold in the open market and Value Trust stockholders will receive a cash payment equal to their pro rata share of such total sales proceeds. The initial net asset value for each share of Global Trust common stock (“NAV”) is expected to be $9.79 per share. Such NAV is preliminary and subject to change. 
The distribution will be made on October 17, 2013 to Value Trust stockholders of record as of the official close of business on October 10, 2013. 
Shares of Global Trust common stock are expected to trade on the New York Stock Exchange on a “when issued” basis from October 8, 2013 through October 17, 2013 under the symbol “RGT wi” and on a “regular way” basis beginning October 18, 2013 under the symbol “RGT.”
