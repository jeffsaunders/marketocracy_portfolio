Company's Online Profile
BUSINESS:  FPIC Insurance Group, Inc.through its subsidiary companies, is a leading provider of medical professional liability (MPL) insurance for physicians, dentists and other healthcare providers. The largest subsidiary, First Professionals Insurance Company, Inc., is the largest writer of MPL insurance in Florida and has served the market for 35 years.

Other core markets include Georgia, Arkansas and Missouri. Licensed in 32 states, the insurance subsidiaries currently have policyholders in a total of 14 states.
Notes:  On October 19, 2011, FPIC Insurance Group, Inc., a Florida corporation, completed its previously announced merger pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated May 23, 2011, by and among The Doctors Company, a California-domiciled reciprocal inter-insurance exchange (“TDC”), Fountain Acquisition Corp., a Florida corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of TDC, and the Company. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub was merged with and into the Company, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub ceased, and the Company continued as the surviving corporation and as a wholly owned subsidiary of TDC. On October 19, 2011, the Company notified The Nasdaq Global Select Market of the completion of the Merger and requested that trading in the Company’s common stock, par value $0.10 per share (the “Common Stock”), be suspended and that the Common Stock be withdrawn from listing on Nasdaq as of the close of market on October 19, 2011. Nasdaq is expected to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) a Notification of Removal from Listing and/or Registration under Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, on Form 25, to delist and deregister the Common Stock. As a result, the Common Stock will no longer be listed on Nasdaq. The Company will file a Form 15 with the SEC to terminate the registration of the Common Stock under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act and to suspend the reporting obligations of the Company under Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act.
