* NOTE: This security is no longer trading as of 12/14/09
Notes:  On December 11, 2009, Pulmuone U.S.A., Inc., a California corporation (“Parent”), and Monterey Gourmet Foods, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), announced that the offer (the “Offer”) by Pulmuone Cornerstone Corporation, a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (“Purchaser”), to purchase all of the outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Common Stock”), and the associated rights to purchase shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share (together with the Common Stock, the “Shares”), of the Company at a price of $2.70 per Share, in cash, without interest and subject to any required withholding taxes, had expired at 12:00 midnight, Eastern Time, on December 10, 2009 (the “Expiration Date”) and that the depositary for the Offer had advised Parent and the Company that approximately 14,461,736 Shares had been validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer (including approximately 200,934 Shares subject to guaranteed delivery procedures). These Shares represented approximately 86.1% of the outstanding Shares. The Offer was not extended. All shares validly tendered in the Offer and not properly withdrawn have been accepted for payment, and Purchaser will pay for all such shares promptly. The Offer was made pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of October 8, 2009, by and among Parent, Purchaser and the Company (the “Merger Agreement”). Under the terms of the Offer, tendering stockholders of the Company who used guaranteed delivery procedures had three trading days after the Expiration Date to complete delivery of their Shares. Rather than wait for completion of such delivery procedures, on December 14, 2009, in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, Purchaser exercised its option (the “Top-Up Option”) to purchase directly from the Company a number of newly-issued Shares sufficient to give the Purchaser ownership of more than 90% of the outstanding Shares at a price of $2.70 per Share, the same amount paid for each Share tendered and accepted for payment by Purchaser pursuant to the Offer. On December 14, 2009, Parent effected a “short-form” merger, pursuant to which Purchaser merged with and into the Company (the “Merger”) in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the “DGCL”), with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (the “Surviving Corporation”). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger, each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger (other than Shares owned by the Company, Parent, Purchaser or any of their respective subsidiaries and Shares held by dissenting stockholders who properly exercise appraisal rights under the DGCL) were converted into the right to receive $2.70 per Share, in cash, without interest and subject to any required withholding taxes (the “Merger Consideration”). The total cost to acquire all outstanding Shares pursuant to the Offer and the Merger was approximately $45.8 million. Pulmuone Holdings Co., Ltd. (“Pulmuone”) and Parent provided Purchaser with sufficient funds to satisfy these obligations, using cash on hand and borrowings from Korea Development Bank consisting of a term loan facility of up to KRW 28 billion and a bridge loan facility of up to $20 million, which will be converted into a term loan facility to the Company.

look for shorts in member's active, long funds
select fundkey from mposition where stockkey=X'f04e0e21390aad5ac0a80116'  and totalshares < 0;
if there are some, then do this
select active, kindkey, primarykey, symbol from mfund where active=1 and kindkey= X'70443ca1391e026fc0a8015c' and primarykey in (select fundkey from mposition where stockkey=X'f04e0e21390aad5ac0a80116'  and totalshares < 0);
no shorts 

now get the login names based on stockkey - fill in the stockkey
select loginname from mmanager where primarykey in (select managerkey from mportfolio where primarykey in (select portfoliokey from mfund where active=1 and kindkey= X'70443ca1391e026fc0a8015c' and primarykey in (select fundkey from mposition where stockkey=X'f04e0e21390aad5ac0a80116'  and totalshares < 0)));
