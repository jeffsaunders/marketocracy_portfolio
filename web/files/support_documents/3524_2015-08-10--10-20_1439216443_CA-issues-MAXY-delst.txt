Company's Online Profile
BUSINESS:  Maxygen is a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing improved versions of protein drugs through internal development and external collaborations and other arrangements. They use their MolecularBreeding directed evolution technology platform, along with ancillary technologies, and extensive protein modification expertise to pursue the creation of biosuperior proteins.

Notes:  As contemplated by the Plan of Complete Liquidation and Dissolution previously approved by Maxygen’s Board of Directors and stockholders, Maxygen has filed a certificate of dissolution with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. The certificate of dissolution, which became effective at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on August 29, 2013, provides for the dissolution of Maxygen under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. Maxygen notified The NASDAQ Stock Market (NASDAQ) of the filing and NASDAQ has advised Maxygen that trading of the company’s common stock was suspended after the regular market officially closed at 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time on August 29, 2013. NASDAQ also has advised Maxygen that it has filed a Notification of Removal from Listing and/or Registration on Form 25 with the SEC to delist the common stock from NASDAQ. In connection with the effectiveness of the certificate of dissolution, Maxygen also closed its stock transfer books and discontinued recording transfers of its common stock, effective as of 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on August 29, 2013. As a result, the common stock, and stock certificates evidencing the shares of common stock, will no longer be assignable or transferable on the company’s books, other than transfers by will, intestate succession or operation of law. As previously announced, the company made an initial liquidating distribution of $2.50 per share of Maxygen’s common stock, which was payable on August 29, 2013. Subject to uncertainties inherent in the winding up of its business, Maxygen may make one or more additional liquidating distributions, which could total as much as $0.09 per share, as the company’s required contingency reserves may be released over time.

look for shorts in member's active, long funds
select fundkey from mposition where stockkey=X'8d8910ac390c6d71c0a8015c'  and totalshares < 0;
if there are some, then do this
select active, kindkey, primarykey, symbol from mfund where active=1 and kindkey= X'70443ca1391e026fc0a8015c' and primarykey in (select fundkey from mposition where stockkey=X'8d8910ac390c6d71c0a8015c'  and totalshares < 0);
no shorts 

now get the login names based on stockkey - fill in the stockkey
select loginname from mmanager where primarykey in (select managerkey from mportfolio where primarykey in (select portfoliokey from mfund where active=1 and kindkey= X'70443ca1391e026fc0a8015c' and primarykey in (select fundkey from mposition where stockkey=X'8d8910ac390c6d71c0a8015c'  and totalshares < 0)));
