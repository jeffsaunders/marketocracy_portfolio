For fund F10101 entered GTC order to buy 7678 shares of ONCS for a limit price of $2.64 but the Ticket Submission has Failed. This is the second time this has happened for stock ONCS. I had earlier entered a trade for Fund R2BLo around 1st march 2016 to buy 10,778 for a limit price of $1.86 which also failed. I know for a fact that ONCS went below $1.77 after I had entered the order but the submission (and multiple RE-submissions) of the trade kept failing. I finally cancelled the order on 21st march since the stock had risen considerably (now trading around $2.94). I think there is some problem with your platform or the stock feed for ONCS is erroneous.

Hi Brandon, a member submitted a case (4416) regarding him trying to buy stock ONCS.  It us not listed on our site.
I have just listed it and should be good to trade tomorrow.    He said that he submitted some limit orders which of course were rejected.   
Can you look at the tickets and get the details?  I can place some backdated trades for him.
Thanks.   Member abharg   funds:  R2BLo  & F10101

Brandon, tomorrow after ONCS is listed on our site, can on behalf of the member a GTC order to buy 7678 shares of ONCS at
the limit price of 2.64?   This order would not have executed today because the low price of the day was only 2.67.
I will enter the backdated trade to buy 10635 ONCS at the price of 1.86.     Thank you. this is for case 4416.   I listed ONCS
today.
