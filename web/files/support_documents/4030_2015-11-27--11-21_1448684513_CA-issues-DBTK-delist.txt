Company's Online Profile
BUSINESS:  Double-Take Software currently develops, sells and supports affordable software that allows IT organizations of all sizes to dynamically move, protect and recover workloads across any distance and any combination of physical and virtual server environments. As enterprise IT systems evolve they increasingly take the form of a dynamic infrastructure where the ability to move information freely, intelligently and securely becomes critical. Their hardware- and application-independent software enables a dynamic infrastructure by efficiently protecting, moving and recovering data created by any application on almost any type or brand of disk storage on any brand of server running on Microsoft Windows operating systems as well as many versions of the Linux operating system. In particular, we believe that through our flagship "Double-Take" software that we are the leading supplier of replication software for Microsoft server environments and that our business is distinguished by our focus on software license and recurring maintenance sales, their productive distribution network and our efficient services infrastructure. Their flagship Double-Take software continuously replicates software and data changes made on a primary operating server to a duplicate server at a different location. Because the duplicate server can commence operating in place of the primary server at almost any time, there flagship software facilitates rapid failover and application recovery in the event of a disaster or other service interruption.

look for shorts in member's active, long funds
select fundkey from mposition where stockkey=X'8c7b553645e5deabc0a80146'  and totalshares < 0;
if there are some, then do this
select active, kindkey, primarykey, symbol from mfund where active=1 and kindkey= X'70443ca1391e026fc0a8015c' and primarykey in (select fundkey from mposition where stockkey=X'8c7b553645e5deabc0a80146'  and totalshares < 0);

select loginname from mmanager where primarykey in (select managerkey from mportfolio where primarykey in (select portfoliokey from mfund where active=1 and kindkey= X'70443ca1391e026fc0a8015c' and primarykey in (select fundkey from mposition where stockkey=X'8c7b553645e5deabc0a80146'  and totalshares < 0)));
