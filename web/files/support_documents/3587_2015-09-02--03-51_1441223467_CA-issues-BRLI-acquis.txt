check the mtickets, look for the last filled one (with shares)
select * from mticket where stockkey=X'd60a0e21390a70d7c0a80116' and shares > 0 order by closed; 
> Row 3215:

look for shorts in member's active, long funds
select fundkey from mposition where stockkey=X'd60a0e21390a70d7c0a80116'  and totalshares < 0;
if there are some, then do this
select active, kindkey, primarykey, symbol from mfund where active=1 and kindkey= X'70443ca1391e026fc0a8015c' and primarykey in (select fundkey from mposition where stockkey=X'd60a0e21390a70d7c0a80116'  and totalshares < 0);
> Row 1:
>       ACTIVE = 1
>      KINDKEY = X'70443ca1391e026fc0a8015c'
>   PRIMARYKEY = X'587245ad51882348c0a80146'
>       SYMBOL = JoeToms4
> Row 2:
>       ACTIVE = 1

>   PRIMARYKEY = X'f4bc6bbe518bbe21c0a80146'
>       SYMBOL = huyehara_hmf1


now get the login names based on stockkey - fill in the stockkey
select loginname from mmanager where primarykey in (select managerkey from mportfolio where primarykey in (select portfoliokey from mfund where active=1 and kindkey= X'70443ca1391e026fc0a8015c' and primarykey in (select fundkey from mposition where stockkey=X'd60a0e21390a70d7c0a80116'  and totalshares < 0)));
> Row 1:

> Row 2:
