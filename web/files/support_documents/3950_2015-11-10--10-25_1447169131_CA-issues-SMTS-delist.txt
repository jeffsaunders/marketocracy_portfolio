Company's Online Profile
BUSINESS:  Somanetics Corp.'s Cerebral Oximeter is the first commercially-available patient monitoring system that noninvasively and continuously monitors changes in the regional oxygen saturation of the blood in an individual's brain.
Notes:  On June 16, 2010, Somanetics Corporation, a Michigan corporation (“Somanetics” or the “Company”), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, as amended (the “Merger Agreement”) with United States Surgical Corporation (“Parent”), a Delaware corporation and indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Covidien plc (“Covidien”), and Covidien DE Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub”). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, upon the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, Merger Sub commenced a tender offer (the “Offer”) on June 25, 2010 to acquire all of the outstanding common shares of the Company at a purchase price of $25.00 per share in cash, without interest, less applicable withholding taxes (the “Consideration”), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase, dated June 25, 2010 (the “Offer to Purchase”), and the related Letter of Transmittal, each as amended or supplemented from time to time. On July 27, 2010, Covidien announced the completion of the Offer. The initial offering period of the Offer expired at 12:01 a.m., New York City time, on July 27, 2010. According to BNY Mellon Shareowner Services, the depositary for the Offer, as of 12:01 a.m., New York City time, on July 27, 2010, a total of approximately 9,583,268 Somanetics common shares were validly tendered and not withdrawn in the Offer, which represented approximately 80.2% of all issued and outstanding Somanetics common shares. Subsequently on July 27, 2010, 225,531 additional Somanetics common shares subject to notices of guaranteed delivery and not withdrawn from the Offer were validly tendered upon actual delivery of such shares to the depositary. Merger Sub has accepted for payment all Somanetics common shares that were validly tendered and not withdrawn, and payment for such shares has been or will be made promptly, in accordance with the terms of the Offer. Parent provided sufficient funds to Merger Sub to acquire all of the outstanding Somanetics common shares. On July 27, 2010, pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub exercised its top-up option, provided for in Section 1.10 of the Merger Agreement, to purchase directly from the Company an additional number of Somanetics common shares sufficient to give Merger Sub ownership of one share more than 90% of the then outstanding Somanetics common shares, when combined with the shares Merger Sub purchased in the Offer and 239,582 previously restricted Somanetics common shares subject to vesting which were validly tendered and not withdrawn immediately following Merger Sub’s acceptance of Somanetics common shares tendered in the initial offering period upon the acceleration of such vesting. Pursuant to the exercise of this top-up option, Merger Sub purchased directly from the Company a total of 8,046,616 newly issued Somanetics common shares (the “Top-Up Shares”) at a price of $25.00 per share in consideration for a promissory note issued to Somanetics in the aggregate amount of $201,165,400. Following the purchase of the Top-Up Shares, on July 27, 2010, Merger Sub effected a short-form merger (the “Merger”) of Merger Sub with and into Somanetics under Michigan and Delaware law, without the need for a meeting of the Company’s shareholders, with Somanetics surviving as an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Covidien. At the effective time of the Merger, each issued and outstanding Somanetics common share that was not tendered pursuant to the Offer was cancelled and converted into the right to receive the Consideration (other than Somanetics common shares that are held as treasury stock or held by Parent or Merger Sub). As a result of the Merger, Somanetics no longer fulfills the numerical listing requirements of The Nasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”). Accordingly, on July 28, 2010, at Somanetics’s request, Nasdaq filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) a Notification of Removal from Listing and/or Registration under Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, on Form 25 thereby effecting the delisting of the Shares from Nasdaq.

look for shorts in member's active, long funds
select fundkey from mposition where stockkey=X'fcfe0e21390aca2ac0a80116'  and totalshares < 0;
if there are some, then do this
select active, kindkey, primarykey, symbol from mfund where active=1 and kindkey= X'70443ca1391e026fc0a8015c' and primarykey in (select fundkey from mposition where stockkey=X'fcfe0e21390aca2ac0a80116'  and totalshares < 0);
no shorts

now get the login names based on stockkey - fill in the stockkey
select loginname from mmanager where primarykey in (select managerkey from mportfolio where primarykey in (select portfoliokey from mfund where active=1 and kindkey= X'70443ca1391e026fc0a8015c' and primarykey in (select fundkey from mposition where stockkey=X'fcfe0e21390aca2ac0a80116'  and totalshares < 0)));

there are 159 fundkeys, save to CA issues SMTS fundkeys.txt

For Beta case
SMTS no longer trades but is still active on our site - need to delist acquired for 25.00

check on 11/10/15   invalidate funds
check MAdmin


this is the weirdest thing

I was getting duplicate acquis one on 7/27/10 and again on 7/29/10
I don't see the CA though
let's do the shorts check:

select * from mcorporateaction where aliaskey is null and BB_SECID='SMTS'  order by BB_EFFECTIVE;

select count(*) from mticket where sourcekey=X'861201484c4f48f8c0a80146';
no tickets - strange

select positionkey from mtrade where ticketkey in (select primarykey from mticket where sourcekey=X'8b1f48fa4c51ec13c0a80146');
select fundkey from mposition where primarykey in (select positionkey from mtrade where ticketkey in (select primarykey from mticket where sourcekey=X'8b1f48fa4c51ec13c0a80146'));
