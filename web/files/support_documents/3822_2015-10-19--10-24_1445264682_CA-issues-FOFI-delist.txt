Notes:  March 23, 2015 -- Rocky Mountain Advisers, LLC and Stewart Investment Advisers today announced the closing of  
reorganization of 
The Boulder Total Return Fund, Inc., (NYSE:BTF) 
The Denali Fund Inc. (NYSE:DNY) and First Opportunity Fund, Inc. (OTC:FOFI) 
the acquired funds into Boulder Growth & Income Fund, Inc (NYSE: BIF). 
with BIF continuing as the surviving fund on March 20, 2015. In the reorganization, 
BIF acquired all of the assets and liabilities of BTF, DNY and FOFI in a tax-free transaction in exchange for 
common shares of BIF. 

The BIF common shares, which are NYSE listed and freely transferrable, will be distributed to stockholders of BTF, DNY and 
FOFI in exchange for their shares of common stock of the respective acquired funds. 
The reorganization occurred based on the relative net asset values (NAV) of BIF, BTF, DNY and FOFI as of the end of the 
trading day on March 20, 2015. Each current holder of BIF shares will retain the same number of BIF shares as held prior 
to the reorganization. 

A holder of BTF shares will receive 3.121182 BIF shares for each BTF share owned; 
a holder of DNY shares will receive 2.439214 BIF shares for each DNY share owned; 
and a holder of FOFI shares will receive 1.111719 BIF shares for each FOFI share owned. 

Fractional shares will be paid in cash. BIF will continue to operate as a registered, non-diversified, closed-end investment company with the investment objective of providing stockholders a high level of total return. BIF will seek to achieve that objective by producing both income and long-term capital appreciation investing in a portfolio of equity and debt securities.
