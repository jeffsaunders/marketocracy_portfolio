MTOX
date:  
ticker:   MTOX

this started as a mis applied ticker change due to a canadian CA that slipped through.  The the original ticker came
back and I found that this no longer trades, so I am treating this as a delist .
On 12/7/2010 MTOX had its ticker changed by a Canadian CA  it became TOX/H CN   (TOX.H)

need to invalidate prices from 2012-12-07
1.  Go to stocks   ssh build@stocks

2. Invalidate prices from 2012-12-07    set the date up in the format yyyy-mm-dd
/Marketocracy/bin/StockPriceBuilder invalidate 2012-12-07
	** note nothing is returned, it take a few seconds to run

3. To check to see if the command worked, do a cat on the log  with today's date  2015-06-05

cat /Marketocracy/Logs/StockPriceBuilder.2015-07-05
D: (11:20:42.722) Invalidate all prices >= 2012-12-07 (4358)

	** note do this on a "fresh" day, otherwise there will be lots of junk to sort through in the output
		here there is only one line, the one we want 
we should be good on prices after the nightly load

look for shorts in member's active, long funds
select fundkey from mposition where stockkey=X'ccbd0e21390a5d29c0a80116'  and totalshares < 0;
if there are some, then do this
select active, kindkey, primarykey, symbol from mfund where active=1 and kindkey= X'70443ca1391e026fc0a8015c' and primarykey in (select fundkey from mposition where stockkey=X'ccbd0e21390a5d29c0a80116'  and totalshares < 0);
no shorts

now get the login names based on stockkey - fill in the stockkey
select loginname from mmanager where primarykey in (select managerkey from mportfolio where primarykey in (select portfoliokey from mfund where active=1 and kindkey= X'70443ca1391e026fc0a8015c' and primarykey in (select fundkey from mposition where stockkey=X'ccbd0e21390a5d29c0a80116'  and totalshares < 0)));

select distinct fundkey from mposition where primarykey in (select positionkey from mtrade where ticketkey in (select primarykey from mticket where sourcekey = X'8ef857ec55994d69c0a86f92'));
there are 106 fundkeys, 

We have the ticker change for this which was bogus and which happened before this acquis.  let's get all fundkeys for
anyone who ever held MTOX and invalidate from the date of the ticker change
select fundkey from mposition where stockkey=X'ccbd0e21390a5d29c0a80116';
there are 338   reprice from 12/7/2010

save these to CA issues MTOX fundkeys.txt

For Beta case  create one   3357
MTOX no longer trades but is  still active on our site - need to delist 


let's check LH the company that acquired MTOX
select distinct stockkey from mstockalias where symbol='LH';
