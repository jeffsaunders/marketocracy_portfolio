Company's Online Profile
FUND DESCRIPTION:  Nuveen California Quality Income Municipal Fund is diversified, closed-end management investment company. The Fund seeks current income exempt from both regular Federal income taxes and California personal income tax, and its secondary investment objective is the enhancement of portfolio value relative to the California municipal bond market through investments in tax-exempt California Municipal Obligations. The Fund will invest substantially all of its assets in a diversified portfolio of tax-exempt California Municipal Obligations rated within the four highest grades, except that 20% of the Fund's assets may be invested in unrated California Municipal Obligation which are considered to be of comparable quality. The Fund's investment advisor is Nuveen Advisory Corp.
