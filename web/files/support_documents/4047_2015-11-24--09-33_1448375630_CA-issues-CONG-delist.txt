Company's Online Profile
FUND DESCRIPTION:  Russell Consistent Growth ETF is an exchange-traded index fund or index ETF which is a separate portfolio of the Russell Exchange Traded Funds Trust, an open-end investment management company. INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE: The Russell Consistent Growth ETF seeks investment results that closely correspond to the total return of the Russell U.S. Large Cap Consistent Growth Index. INDEX DESCRIPTION: The Russell U.S. Large Cap Consistent Growth Index is designed to select securities intended to produce performance that is similar to professional investment managers using a consistent growth investment discipline. This discipline focuses on companies with above average earnings expectations over a long term horizon and with consistent historical earnings growth. Starting with the Russell 1000 Index (an index comprised of U.S. stocks), the Index includes companies that demonstrate growth potential as measured by: (1) average to high consensus forecasted earnings; (2) consistent earnings as measured by average to low earnings per share volatility over the past five years; and (3) efficient asset utilization as measured by average to high return on assets for the prior quarter. The Index excludes companies with low anticipated growth prospects as measured by a low price-to-book ratio. The Index Provider, Frank Russell Company, determines the composition and relative weightings of the securities in the Index and publishes information regarding the market value of the Index. The Index is reconstituted quarterly. FUND STRATEGY: The Fund is an index-based exchange-traded fund that seeks investment results that closely correspond to the total return of the Index. A passive or indexing approach to try to achieve the Fund’s investment objective is used. Indexing may reduce the chance that the Fund will substantially outperform its Index but also may reduce some of the risks of active management, such as security selection. Unlike many investment companies, the Fund does not try to beat the Index it tracks and does not seek temporary defensive positions when markets decline or appear overvalued. The Fund will normally invest at least 80% of its total assets in common stocks that comprise the Index. The Fund’s investment adviser using a replication strategy, generally invests in all of the stocks comprising the Index in proportion to their weightings in the Index. However, under various circumstances, it may not be possible or practicable to purchase all of those stocks in those weightings. In those circumstances, the Fund may purchase a sample of stocks in the Index. There may also be instances in which the Advisor may choose to overweight another stock in the Index, purchase securities not in the Index which is believed are appropriate to substitute for certain securities in the Index or utilize various combinations of other available investment techniques, in seeking to track the Index. The Fund may sell stocks that are represented in the Index in anticipation of their removal from the Index or purchase stocks not represented in the Index in anticipation of their addition to the Index. FUND MANAGEMENT: Russell Investment Management Company (RIMCo) serves as the investment adviser to the Fund.
Notes:  The issuer has determined to liquidate this Fund on October 24, 2012. The Fund will be closed to new investors at the close of regular trading on October 9, 2012; accordingly, trading in the Fund will be suspended before the opening of business on October 17, 2012.
