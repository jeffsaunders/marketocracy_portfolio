let's log in as member cfalcon and look at CFIT fund



ah - this one causes you to die, too



Assessment:
Knowles Corp spun off from Dover Corporation with the following terms:

CP_PAY_DT       2014-02-28
CP_RECORD_DT    2014-02-19
Effective date: 2014-03-03

spun off from DOV   1 for 2

As is typical with spin offs, we have problems, but this is not the usual problem.  Normally we get collisions
where two separate paths are created (via Bloomberg) and we end up with two distinct, active stockkeys for the same ticker

In the case of Knowles we do have two distinct paths for this company.

1.  we have the spin off of KN-W from DOV.      There are 342 total mtickets for this stockkey.  315 are
generated by this spin off CA.    27 are member generated.

2.  The second path to create another Knowles corp started as a list of KNw and the this was follow up with a ticker change
to KN.   

3.  KN is the "real" ticker in the market.

4.  KN is in the xignite feed,  KN-W is not in this feed.

5.  There are NO historical prices for KN-W (using the script).    I have no idea how members could have generated
filled trades for KN-W but we have them. 

6.  oh - bananaslug (the member I flagged whose fund BSDIV causes PortfolioAdmin or Portfolio to crash) does have KN-W
in his BSDIV fund.  I found this with db queries.

7.  I looked at one of the member-generated mtickets for KN-W.   member is cfalcon and his fund is CFIT.  
looking at the mticket, he bought 80 shares of KN-W.    He did not get shares from the spin off.  
If I go to this account and try to look at the CFIT fund, the application dies.


8.  We need to consolidate the two paths and make one Knowles Corp.   And use the KN symbol.

KN trades in the real world.  

8.1  probably back out the spin off of KN-W
8.2  capture all of the member generated mtickets for KN-W 
8.3  re-do the spin off as a DVD_STOCK, have to check the record, effective and pay dates to make sure
that we have KN on our site on the appropriate dates
8.4  move the member generated tickets for 8.2 over to the KN, tickle the tickets and invalidate the funds
8.5  delete all traces of KN-W on our site.

the critical dates from this CA: 
CP_PAY_DT       2014-02-28
CP_RECORD_DT    2014-02-19
Effective date: 2014-03-03

spun off from DOV   1 for 2

The other path: 
2014-02-14  is when KNw listed
2014-03-03  is when the tcker change  KNw to KN occurred

I want to do a DVD_STOCK will this work given this history and dates in place?
