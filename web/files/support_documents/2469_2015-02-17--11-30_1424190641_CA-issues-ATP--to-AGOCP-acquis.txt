Security has been Called for:  Friday, November 17, 2006
10/26/06 -- A QOL user's broker has informed him that AGOCP will be called on 11/17/2006 for the redemption price of $10 plus $3.24476 in accrued dividends. We can find no information to confirm the call but assume that the information is correct. __________ Aug. 18, 2006 -- Umbrella Bancorp, Inc. announced today that it has entered into an agreement to sell all of the capital stock of Flower Bank, fsb, a federal savings bank and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, to American Home Mortgage Investment Corp. for $16,250,000 in cash, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. American Home is a real estate investment trust engaged in the business of investing in mortgage-backed securities and mortgage loans resulting from the securitization of residential mortgage loans that its subsidiaries originate and service. The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2006, subject to various closing conditions, including Umbrella shareholder approval and the receipt by American Home of customary regulatory approvals. As part of its agreement with American Home, the Company will utilize approximately $13.2 million of the proceeds from the transaction to redeem the outstanding 11% Capital Securities of Argo Capital Trust Co. Following consummation of the transaction, the Company will engage in the mortgage banking business, acquire strategic positions in other financial institutions and develop a corporate restructuring and workout group to assist other entities. __________ June 10, 2004. Umbrella Bancorp, Inc., the holding company of UmbrellaBank, FSB, and Argo Capital Trust Co., announced today that the Company has elected to defer the regularly scheduled distribution on the 11.0% Capital Securities of the Trust which trade under the symbol “AGOCP” on the Over-the-Counter-Market. Business developments and the effect of the regulatory restrictions imposed by Agreements imposed by the Office of Thrift Supervision since August 2002 were factors in this decision, stated President and CEO John G. Yedinak. The Company does not expect to resume payments of quarterly distributions on the 11% Capital Securities until it determines that the Company has reached a level of profitability sufficient to support such payments. ______ November 14, 2003. Umbrella Bancorp, Inc., the holding company for UmbrellaBank, FSB, and Argo Capital Trust Co., announced today that the Company and the Trust have filed Form 15S with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and plans to deregister Umbrella's Common Stock and the 11% Capital Securities of the Trust which trade under the symbol "ATP_P" on the American Stock Exchange.
