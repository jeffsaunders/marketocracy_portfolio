Company's Online Profile
BUSINESS:  The Princeton Review helps students and schools successfully handle standardized tests and admissions to college and graduate school. Founded in 1981 and headquartered in New York City, The Princeton Review offers classroom and online test preparation courses, private tutoring, and operates educational websites. The company's free website, www.review.com, enables students to research, select, apply to, prepare for, and learn how to pay for their higher education, while its Embark management tools streamline the university admissions and recruiting processes. The K-12 division helps schools strengthen their students' academic skills and improve their performance on high-stakes state tests with its powerful online service, www.homeroom.com, and related print products and professional development seminars. The Princeton Review also authors more than 175 print and software titles on test preparation, college and graduate school selection and admissions and related topics.
Notes:  May 11, 2012, The Princeton Review, Inc. (the “Company”) voluntarily filed Form 15 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) to suspend the Company’s SEC reporting obligations. Upon the filing of the Form 15, the Company’s obligation to file periodic and current reports with the SEC, including Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K, will be immediately suspended. The Company is eligible to file Form 15 because its common shares are held of record by less than 300 persons.

look for shorts in member's active, long funds
select fundkey from mposition where stockkey=X'da896cfb3b51433cc0a801dc'  and totalshares < 0;
if there are some, then do this
select active, kindkey, primarykey, symbol from mfund where active=1 and kindkey= X'70443ca1391e026fc0a8015c' and primarykey in (select fundkey from mposition where stockkey=X'da896cfb3b51433cc0a801dc'  and totalshares < 0);
no shorts

now get the login names based on stockkey - fill in the stockkey
select loginname from mmanager where primarykey in (select managerkey from mportfolio where primarykey in (select portfoliokey from mfund where active=1 and kindkey= X'70443ca1391e026fc0a8015c' and primarykey in (select fundkey from mposition where stockkey=X'da896cfb3b51433cc0a801dc'  and totalshares < 0)));
