what was the spin off?

http://finance.yahoo.com/news/darden-completes-spin-off-four-223000219.html
ORLANDO, Fla., Nov. 9, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Darden Restaurants, Inc. (DRI) ("Darden") announced today that it successfully completed its previously announced spin-off of select real estate and restaurant assets into Four Corners Property Trust, Inc. (NYSE:FCPT) ("FCPT").  FCPT has become an independent, public company that intends to elect and qualify to be treated as a real estate investment trust (REIT) effective January 1, 2016. 

Under the terms of the spin-off, Darden shareholders received one common share of FCPT for every three shares of Darden common stock held as of the record date, which was the close of business on November 2, 2015.  Darden shareholders will receive cash in lieu of fractional FCPT shares.  The spin-off is expected to be tax-free to Darden shareholders.  Darden has received opinions from Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP and KPMG LLP that the spin-off will qualify as tax-free and has received a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service on certain issues relevant to the qualification of the spin-off as tax-free.

In connection with the spin-off, Darden received cash proceeds from FCPT of $315 million, which it anticipates using, together with cash on hand, to retire approximately $1 billion in debt in the near future while maintaining its investment grade credit profile.

the new symbol is NYSE:FCPT

one share of FCPT for every three shares of DRI as of the record date of November 2, 2015

yes it does as of 11/10/15

maybe we have an FCPT already in the database and that is why the SPIN did not happen?

let's see if anyone holds this   any mtickets?
select count(*) from mticket where stockkey=X'd643510f5632a83fc0a86fab';

Let's get rid of this stockkey altogether since no one holds it 
STOCKKEY = X'd643510f5632a83fc0a86fab'

set commit false;

delete from mstock where primarykey=  X'd643510f5632a83fc0a86fab';

let's check to see if FCPT was created

select distinct stockkey from mstockalias where symbol='FCPT';
> Row 1:

it is there

it is there - need to set the CUSIP
update mstockalias set CUSIP='35086T109' where PRIMARYKEY = X'd30370df56434df4c0a86fab';

what exchange is this on, should be NYSE
select * from mexchange where primarykey=X'9d5b2f1d390a440bc0a8015c';

We don't have the GICS or style set.  
have to do this

how many mtickets were created?
select count(*) from mticket where stockkey=X'd30270df56434df4c0a86fab';

Let's get the fundkeys for those mtickets that were generated

select primarykey from mticket where sourcekey=X'd2fc70df56434df3c0a86fab';
there are 644 fundkeys  save to CA issues FCPT spin off from DRI fundkeys.txt

write the case
On 11/10/15  DRI spun off FCPT.   Holders got 1 share of FCPT for each share of DRI held on the record date
of 11/2/15.   I have applied this manually.    I will need to invalidate the funds and reprice as of the pay date
of 11/10/15   case is 3967
