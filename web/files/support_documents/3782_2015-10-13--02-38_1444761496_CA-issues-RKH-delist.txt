Shareholders of the Funds may sell their holdings on NYSE Arca Inc. until market close on December 12, 2014. The Funds’ shares will no longer trade on NYSE Arca after market close on December 12, 2014, and the shares will subsequently be de-listed. Shareholders who continue to hold shares of any of the Funds on the Funds’ liquidation date, which is expected to be on or about December 23, 2014, will receive a liquidating distribution of cash in the cash portion of their brokerage accounts equal to the amount of the net asset value of their shares. Proceeds from the liquidation are currently scheduled to be sent to shareholders on or about December 23, 2014. _______________ On December 4, 2014, the Board of Trustees of Market Vectors ETF Trust approved the liquidation and dissolution of the following funds (the “Funds”):1/30/2012 -- 2 for 1 forward stock split effective 2/13/2012. ____________ 12/20/2011 -- The previously announced Exchange Offer for this HOLDRS Trust has expired. Sufficient shares of the issue were tendered so as to satisfy the conditions of the offer. Accordingly, each tendered HOLDRS Depositary Trust Receipt will be exchanged into one share of the related Market Vectors ETF. Additionally, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated has determined to terminate the Depositary Trust Agreement of this HOLDRs Trust. Accordingly, trading in the issue will be suspended before the opening of business on Wednesday, December 21, 2011. Open orders will be canceled at such time. ____________ 12/19/2011 -- Please note that the following Market Vectors ETFs will trade under the symbols previously used by the following HOLDRS Trusts which will be suspended prior to the open on December 21, 2011: Biotech HOLDRS Trust (BBH), Oil Service HOLDRS Trust (OIH), Pharmaceutical HOLDRS Trust (PPH), Regional Bank HOLDRS Trust (RKH), Semiconductor HOLDRS Trust (SMH), and Retail HOLDRS Trust (RTH). ____________ 11/11/2011 -- Each outstanding Depositary Trust Receipt ("RKH HOLDRS") validly tendered by a Regional Bank HOLDRS Trust investor and delivered pursuant to the Offer will be exchanged into one share of Beneficial Interest of Market Vectors Bank and Brokerage ETF. The Offer is conditioned upon, among other things the occurrence of the following events: (i) RKH HOLDRS having a net aggregate value of $25 million having been validly tendered pursuant to the Offer (the “Minimum Condition”) or that condition having been waived; (ii) each of the Agreement Conditions (defined in Section 16 of the prospectus – “Certain Conditions of the Offer”) having been satisfied or waived; and (iii) each of the General Conditions (defined in Section 16 of the prospectus – “Certain Conditions of the Offer”) having been satisfied or waived. Based on the closing market price per RKH on November 7, 2011, the Minimum Condition would be satisfied if 361,324 shares of RKH HOLDRS are validly tendered pursuant to the Offer. NYSE Arca anticipates halting trading in this issue at approximately 10:30 A.M. on the expiration date. If the Minimum Condition is satisfied, trading will not resume and the issue will be suspended from trading prior to the opening on Tuesday, December 21, 2011. Open orders will be canceled at such time.
