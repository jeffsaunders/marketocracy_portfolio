Several of the last batch of orders placed three days ago for this folio were "doubled" from 8.25% resulting in those positions becoming 2x their intended weight one of the order is still pending, afraid it too will end up becoming 2x its intended weight The doubling of orders appear to have only affected RBMF alone, since trades were placed for RPC as well. Please take the necessary steps to verify my original trades, correct the doubled orders and perhaps cancel the currently open doubled pending order The trade wizard does not appear to add or subtract the change in shares which occur when a trade is placed. Its caused issues in RPC which were simple to avoid in the legacy site to becoming an issue on any given day. Seven days would render a fund ineligible for rankling so I wonder why its still an issue after all these months of use.
