Ticker Symbol: BARS*     CUSIP: 25490F209     Exchange: NYSEA
Security Type:   Index ETF  ---  ETF SubType:   Short Index ETF
* NOTE: This security is no longer trading as of 12/30/14

Notes:  December 10, 2014 -- The Direxion Shares ETF Trust II has decided to liquidate and close the Direxion Daily 
Gold Bear 3X Shares (Ticker: BARS) exchange-traded fund based on the recommendation of Direxion Asset Management, 
LLC, the Fund’s Sponsor. Due to the Fund’s inability to attract sufficient investment assets, Direxion believes the 
Fund cannot continue to conduct its business and operations in an economically efficient manner. As a result, the 
Board concluded that liquidating and closing the Fund would be in the best interests of the Fund and its 
shareholders. Shares of the Fund will stop trading on the NYSE Arca, Inc., and will no longer be open to purchase 
by investors, at the close of regular trading on December 26, 2014. Shareholders may sell their holdings in the 
Fund prior to the closing date, and those transactions are subject to customary brokerage charges. Between the 
closing date and the liquidation date, shareholders may only be able to sell their shares to certain broker-dealers 
and there is no assurance that there will be a market for the Fund during that time period. On December 30, 2014, 
the Fund will liquidate its assets and distribute cash pro rata to shareholders who have not previously redeemed 
or exchanged their shares. These payments are taxable and will include any accrued capital gains and dividends. 
The Fund’s net asset value will reflect the costs of closing the Fund as calculated on the liquidation date. The 
Fund will close when the distributions are complete.
