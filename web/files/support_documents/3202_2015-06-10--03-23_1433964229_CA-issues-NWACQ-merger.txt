Company's Online Profile
BUSINESS:  Northwest Airlines is one of the world’s largest airlines with hubs at Detroit, Minneapolis/St. Paul, Memphis, Tokyo and Amsterdam, and approximately 1,400 daily departures. Northwest is a member of SkyTeam, an airline alliance that offers customers one of the world’s most extensive global networks. Northwest and its travel partners serve more than 1,000 cities in excess of 160 countries on six continents.

Notes:  October 29, 2008 -- Delta Air Lines, Inc (NYSE: DAL) and Northwest Airlines, Inc. today merged, creating a premier global airline with service to nearly all of the world’s major travel markets. Upon emergence from bankruptcy on May 31, 2007, the company adopted fresh-start reporting. Under fresh-start reporting, Northwest revalued its assets and liabilities to estimated market values. In addition to these fair value adjustments, the company changed its presentation of certain regional carrier-related revenue and expense items, acquired Mesaba Aviation, and changed its policies pertaining to the accounting for frequent flyer obligations and breakage of passenger tickets. These non-cash adjustments affected Northwest’s balance sheet, statement of operations, and statement of cash flows. As a result of the fresh-start reporting adjustments, Northwest’s financial statements on and after June 1, 2007, are not comparable to its previously issued financial statements.

look for shorts in member's active, long funds
select fundkey from mposition where stockkey=X'f28a0e21390ab2d0c0a80116' and totalshares < 0;
if there are some, then do this
select active, kindkey, primarykey, symbol from mfund where active=1 and kindkey= X'70443ca1391e026fc0a8015c' and primarykey in (select fundkey from mposition where stockkey=X'f28a0e21390ab2d0c0a80116' and totalshares < 0);

now get the login names based on stockkey - fill in the stockkey
select loginname from mmanager where primarykey in (select managerkey from mportfolio where primarykey in (select portfoliokey from mfund where active=1 and kindkey= X'70443ca1391e026fc0a8015c' and primarykey in (select fundkey from mposition where stockkey=X'f28a0e21390ab2d0c0a80116' and totalshares < 0)));
