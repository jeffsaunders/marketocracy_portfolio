select fundkey from mposition where stockkey=X'f8620e21390abf7ac0a80116'  and totalshares < 0;
if there are some, then do this
select active, kindkey, primarykey, symbol from mfund where active=1 and kindkey= X'70443ca1391e026fc0a8015c' and primarykey in (select fundkey from mposition where stockkey=X'f8620e21390abf7ac0a80116'  and totalshares < 0);
