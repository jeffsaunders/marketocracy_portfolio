Hey Gary, it showing as EPCYY in the system for some reason. Very strange. We'll get this sorted it, and back trade it if need be so that it fills when it was supposed to. Might not happen till Monday as we have to source why its showing up as EPCYY in the trading system.

ah it didn't fill good 
team:    case 4381   member  AQAFundManager entered a buy of EPC (as Edgewell Personal Care Company) on the new site yesterday (3/3/16).
We don't have this stock listed on legacy.    We have an old stock which no longer trades and had this symbol years ago but that changed to 
EPCYY on 2007-11-03.  The company is EPCOS AG ADS and this delisted back on 2009-12-23.
I see the order as open and unfilled on legacy.

So there are two problems.
1.  We missed the list of new EPC as Edgewell Personal Care Company.  I will enter that now.
2.  The second more serious problem, I think, is that the order that came over from the new site got translated into
a buy for EPCYY.   It found EPC but this was not an active ticker.   The latest ticker, even though it was delisted, was EPCYY so that was grabbed. 

I'll do a list for new EPC and once that is up, I can fill the order with the correct stock(key) and give him a fair price for 3/3/16.
But we need to prevent from orders being taken that would result in the wrong stock.

adaher
there was a drop in price from 6/30/15 to 7/1/15 - we need to
1.  do a ticker change to EPC
2.  do a 1349 for 1 split
3.  then spin off ENR   probably need to juggle prices, too 
people that are holding ENR should now have EPC

Assessment.

This is going to take a lot of work.

The prices we have for ENR need to be moved.   trades for ENR need to be adjusted.   

1.  Let's look at trades done for ENR that are on 7/1/15 or later that have fills 
these trades got new ENR prices.  
2.  Do the ticker change from ENR to EPC


Let's look at trades see how bad this is.  
select count(*) from mticket where stockkey=X'b4c710ac390c6e04c0a8015c' and closed > TIMESTAMP'2015-06-30 00:00:00.000000' and shares > 0;
> Row 1:
>   _C001 = 11.000000

that isn't that bad! 
there are only 11 trades executed with shares after 6/30/15.

ok, before we started, we looked at members who held ENR (old) on 6/30/15
this person had 1000 shares 
940D11303A8373BFC0A80118, JOMF, jdrehmer, 1000

let's see what he has now   first invalidate the funds
/Marketocracy/bin/fptool invalidateFund 940D11303A8373BFC0A80118
now log in as 
jdrehmer  JOMF  let's look at the ledger on 20150701

Type	Symbol	Quantity	Price	Net	Commission	SEC Fee
Split Sell	ENR	1,000	$0.00	$0.00	$0.00	$0.00

Stock Dividend Buy	 	1,349	$0.00	$0.00	$0.00	$0.00
 	 	 


ah this is perfect
let's analyze each
the split sell
Hexkey: B8CF067756DB76E8C0A86FAB
select stockkey from mticket where primarykey=X'B8CF067756DB76E8C0A86FAB';

select * from mstockalias where stockkey=X'b4c710ac390c6e04c0a8015c' order by "date";
	this is ENR/EPC
the split buy 
Hexkey: B8D4067756DB76E8C0A86FAB
select stockkey from mticket where primarykey=X'B8D4067756DB76E8C0A86FAB';
