Company's Online Profile
FUND DESCRIPTION:  The Boulder Growth & Income Fund, Inc. is an exchange-traded closed-end fund or a closed-end ETF which is officially described as a diversified, closed-end management investment company. INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE: The Company's investment objective is total return. FUND STRATEGY: The Fund seeks to produce both income and long-term capital appreciation by investing in a portfolio of equity and debt securities. The Fund invests primarily in common stocks, including dividend paying common stocks such as those issued by utilities, real estate investment trusts (“REITs’’) and regulated investment companies. The Fund also invests in fixed income securities such as U.S. government securities, preferred stocks and bonds. The Fund invests primarily in securities of U.S.-based companies and to a lesser extent in foreign equity securities and sovereign debt, in each case denominated in foreign currency. The Fund has no restrictions on its ability to invest in foreign securities. FUND MANAGEMENT: The Fund's two registered investment advisors are Boulder Investment Advisers, LLC ("BIA"), and Stewart Investment Advisers, ("SIA") who are headquartered in Boulder, Colorado and Barbados respectively. BIA and SIA employ Stewart R. Horejsi as their portfolio manager. When Mr. Horejsi resides in the United States, he is employed by BIA and when he resides in Barbados, he is employed by SIA. Mr. Horejsi is the Fund's primary portfolio manager and provides advisory services to the Fund regarding asset allocation and investments in common stocks. Mr. Horejsi's family interests own approximately 44% of the shares of BTF and 23% of the shares of BIF.

The BIF common shares, which are NYSE listed and freely transferrable, will be distributed to stockholders of BTF, DNY and 
FOFI in exchange for their shares of common stock of the respective acquired funds. 
The reorganization occurred based on the relative net asset values (NAV) of BIF, BTF, DNY and FOFI as of the end of the 
trading day on March 20, 2015. Each current holder of BIF shares will retain the same number of BIF shares as held prior 
to the reorganization. 

A holder of BTF shares will receive 3.121182 BIF shares for each BTF share owned; 
a holder of DNY shares will receive 2.439214 BIF shares for each DNY share owned; 
and a holder of FOFI shares will receive 1.111719 BIF shares for each FOFI share owned. 

Fractional shares will be paid in cash. BIF will continue to operate as a registered, non-diversified, closed-end investment company with the investment objective of providing stockholders a high level of total return. BIF will seek to achieve that objective by producing both income and long-term capital appreciation investing in a portfolio of equity and debt securities.
