A Mutual Fund Trading Simulation System using real-time data from live stock exchanges on Wall Street.

The primary purpose of the system is to provide a platform by which subscribers/members can create portfolios, buy and sell individual stocks, and practice/demonstrate their stock picking talents. Those with particularly strong natural talent are then invited to create and manage real funds using real money, including that of third-party investors. Essentially, it's a "farm league" for the development of those with natural talent ("street smart"), as opposed to those who have been trained in business school ("book smart").

The primary platform is a standard LAMP stack, using Linux, Apache, MySQL/MariaDB, and PHP5 with heavy use of Javascript (jQuery & Bootstrap) and the HighCharts library.

Backend work is a combination of CLI PHP along with Python, controlled by BASH and PERL, with a sprinkling of Objective-C for the integration with a legacy Apple OSX based precursor.
